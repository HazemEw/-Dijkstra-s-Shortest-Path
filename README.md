# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Project

## Overview
This project implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm to find the shortest route between two cities on a world map. Each city is defined with its own coordinates. The program allows users to specify the starting point and the destination for their trip, calculates the shortest path, and visually displays the route and distance on the map.

## Key Features
- **City Coordinates**: Defines cities with their specific coordinates on a world map.
- **User Input**: Requests the user to specify the beginning and destination of the trip.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between the specified cities.
- **Visual Display**: Displays the calculated route and distance visually on the map.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for implementing the algorithm.
- **JavaFX**: For building the user interface and visualizing the map and routes.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (for building the project)

### Installation and Running

  **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/HazemEw/dijkstras-shortest-path.git
